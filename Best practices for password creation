1. Use Long Passwords
-Aim for at least 12–16 characters.
-The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.
-Consider using a passphrase made of random words, such as correct horse battery staple.

2. Include a Mix of Characters
-Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols (for example, @, #, $, %).
-Avoid predictable substitutions like P@ssw0rd, since attackers try those first.

3. Avoid Personal or Common Information
-Don’t use names, birthdays, pet names, or simple words from the dictionary.
-Avoid sequences like 12345, abcdef, or keyboard patterns like qwerty.

4. Use Unique Passwords for Every Account
-Never reuse passwords across sites.
-If one site is breached, attackers can try the same password elsewhere.
