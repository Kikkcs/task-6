1. How Complexity Improves Security
-Aspect	Weak Password	Complex Password
-Brute-force resistance	Easy to crack quickly	Takes much longer to crack
-Dictionary attack	Often appears in common wordlists	Rarely appears in lists
-Pattern predictability	Follows predictable patterns	Harder to guess
-Randomness (entropy)	Few combinations	Many possible combinations
-When a password includes a wider range of characters and is longer, it increases the total number of possible combinations. This makes brute-force attacks—where every possible combination is tried—take far more time.

2. How Complexity Scales with Length and Variety
-Password Type	Length	Possible Combinations	Approximate Crack Time*
-Lowercase only	6	26⁶ ≈ 308 million	Less than a second
-Mixed case + digits	8	62⁸ ≈ 218 trillion	Hours to days
-All types (letters, digits, symbols)	12	95¹² ≈ 5.4×10²³	Thousands of years
-*Actual times depend on the attacker’s computing power.

3. Why Complexity Alone Isn’t Enough
-Even a complex password can be compromised if:
-It is reused on multiple sites.
-It is stored or shared insecurely.
-It is short despite using special characters (for example, P@55w!).
-Therefore, complexity should be combined with other good security practices, such as using longer passphrases and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).

4. Best Practices
-Use at least 12–16 characters.
-Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
-Avoid personal information or common words.
-Do not reuse passwords across sites.
-Use a password manager to create and store complex passwords.
-Enable MFA wherever possible.
